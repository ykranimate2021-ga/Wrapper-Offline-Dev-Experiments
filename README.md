# Wrapper: Offline - Experimental Branch
**This is an experimental version of Wrapper: Offline that will likely not be usable most of the time. Currently, this repository is being used for saving our progress of v2.0.0, more information in README.md.**

# Wrapper: Offline v2.0.0
Version 2.0.0 of Wrapper: Offline is an update that plans to completely redefine how GoAnimate is used, bringing a new framework for the API as well as a completely remade studio! This "remade studio" will *not* use Adobe Flash, meaning that there's nothing in your way of using GoAnimate's themes! This will also means that many things previously seen undoable or hard to do will be extremely easy. This includes things such as *real* asset importing, and *real* video exporting! This is currently in heavy development, progress can be seen here when committed.
